# CSS Selectors

## Element selector

```css
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

- This applies the CSS to the entire body element.
- All the elements present inside the `<body>` will inherit the `font-size` property.

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
```

- Here, all the paragraphs will have blue color.
- So, element selector, selects all elements of same type.

## Class selector

```css
.gray {
  color: gray;
}
```

- Class selectors applies CSS to the classes which are added to HTML elements.
- We can add same class to multiple different elements in order to group them under the same class name and then apply a commong CSS style.
- Class selector is more specific than the element selector.
- Hence, it overrules the element selector properties.

## ID Selector

```css
#second-paragraph {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

- The ID selector is the most specific selector.
- Here, it would apply CSS property only to the element with id=second-paragraph.
- IDs in HTML are unique and cannot be repeated.
- ID selector should not be used in CSS.
- Class selector should be most commonly used.

## Group selector

```css
h1,
h2 {
  color: pink;
}
```

- Here, we have grouped all h1 and h2 elements and applied a common CSS.

## Nested Selector

```css
h1 h2 {
  color: red;
}
```

- This ruleset applies only to any h2 present inside the h1.

## Universal Selector

```css
* {
  color: blue;
}
```

- Applies to the entire page and all the elements.
- Has the lowest precedence.
- Widely used to reset values.

## How the cascade works?

- CSS works like a waterfall.
- So if we have a ruleset for p first and later after couple of other rulesets we have another ruleset for p, the last ruleset will override it provided both have same selectors.
- Thus, we need to use more of classes to increase the specificity and reduce use of element selectors.

## Inheritance

- A child element will inherit the styling of its parent element.
- `<body>` element is the parent of all the elements.
- So all the elements will be inheriting some or the other style of `<body>` until we override it.
- Setting any rule in universal selector will not be inherited because it is a selector which selects all the elements. Its not a parent of any selector.
- Inheritance helps use to achieve DRY principle where we do not write rule for every selector but rather write it once and then inherit it.
- But not all elements inherit.
- One of the example is form elements which does not inherit the typography of the body.
- In order to inherit, we can do the following:

```css
body {
  font-size: 22px;
}

button,
input,
select,
textarea {
  font: inherit;
}
```

## `!important`

```css
p {
  color: red;
}

p {
  color: blue !important;
}
```

- Paragraphy will have color as blue because it `!important` overrides everything.
